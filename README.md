*Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines*

Main goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, predicting two probabilities: one for h1n1_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine.

Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
